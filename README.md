# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate the capabilities of using API routes and gain experience with deploying apps through Heroku. The goal was to build the entire backend of an application by editing little to none of the front end and it was a success! This app is a notetaker app that allows you to write and title notes and when you click on an existing note then that note will be displayed. 

## Installation

This application requires node to be installed and can be initialized through the terminal. 
- 1) Open the integrated terminal
- 2) Enter 'npm i' to install the necessary packages
- 3) Enter 'node server.js' 
- 4) Click the link that comes up saying local host is live

This application can also be accessed through this link: 

## Usage 

With this app you can write and title notes for whatever you like!
